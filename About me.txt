Beautiful stories go extinct like they never happened when there is no one to tell it like it occured.

I am a highly motivated individual who uses the power of compelling storytelling through freelance content writing and poetry, advocacy and awareness to tell the stories of people who can't speak for themselves as well as Brands itching to get their customers' attention with the right voice and tone. I WRITE their stories and inspire them to take the reins too.

I believe that mentally healthy individuals would go on to excel academically and professionally. 

I also believe that to sustain life, we need to collaboratively protect the Earth through intentional plastic recycling and upcycling technologies.

Most of all, I care intentionally about people which is why I'm so excited to connect with you.
